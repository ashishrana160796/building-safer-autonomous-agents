ABSTRACT="The highway-env reinforcement learning tasks provides a good abstract
testbed for designing driving agents for specific driving scenarios like
lane changing, parking or intersections etc. But, generally these driving
simulation environments often restrict themselves to safer and precise
trajectories. However, we clearly know that real driving tasks often
involve very high risk collision prone unexpected situations. Hence, the
autonomous model-free driving agents prepared in these environments are
blind to certain low probability traffic collision corner cases. In our
study we systematically focus on generating adversarial driving collision
prone scenarios with dangerous driving behavior and heavy traffic in order
to create robust autonomous agents. In our experimentation we train model
free learning agents with additional collision prone scenario simulations
and compare their efficacy with regular simulation based agents.
Ultimately, we create a causal experimentation setup which successfully
accounts for the performance improvements across different driving
scenarios by utilizing learning from risky driving situations."
